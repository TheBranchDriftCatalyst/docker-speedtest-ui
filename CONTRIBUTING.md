### Documentation

We need your help with improving documentation to the project. This might be the easiest way for
you to contribute, because you don't even need to clone the repo but can edit or create new `.md`
files right from GitHub website as described.

#### Style Guide

Our linter will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status
of your code styling by simply running: `npm lint`

However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up. If you are unsure about
something, looking at [Airbnb's Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you
in the right direction.
